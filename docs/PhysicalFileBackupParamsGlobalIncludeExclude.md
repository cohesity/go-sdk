## Methods

### NewPhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude

`func NewPhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude() *PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude`

NewPhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude instantiates a new PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewPhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExcludeWithDefaults

`func NewPhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExcludeWithDefaults() *PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude`

NewPhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExcludeWithDefaults instantiates a new PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetExcludeVec

`func (o *PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude) GetExcludeVec() []string`

GetExcludeVec returns the ExcludeVec field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetExcludeVecOk

`func (o *PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude) GetExcludeVecOk() (*[]string, bool)`

GetExcludeVecOk returns a tuple with the ExcludeVec field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetExcludeVec

`func (o *PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude) SetExcludeVec(v []string)`

SetExcludeVec sets ExcludeVec field to given value.

### HasExcludeVec

`func (o *PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude) HasExcludeVec() bool`

HasExcludeVec returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### SetExcludeVecNil

`func (o *PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude) SetExcludeVecNil(b bool)`

 SetExcludeVecNil sets the value for ExcludeVec to be an explicit nil

### UnsetExcludeVec
`func (o *PhysicalFileBackupParamsGlobalIncludeExclude) UnsetExcludeVec()`

UnsetExcludeVec ensures that no value is present for ExcludeVec, not even an explicit nil
